SQL Projects Repository

Welcome to the SQL Projects Repository! This repository contains two SQL-based data analysis projects, one analyzing **COVID-19 Data** and the other focusing on the **AdventureWorks2019 Sample Database**.

Each project demonstrates the power of SQL queries to extract valuable insights from databases. The projects are structured with both data preparation and analysis queries. You'll find detailed steps to create views, perform aggregations, and visualize key metrics from both datasets.


## Projects Overview

### Project 1: COVID-19 Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data from a fictional or external dataset. The queries help explore COVID-19 metrics across different regions and provide insights into infection rates, vaccination statistics, and mortality rates. The focus is mainly on global, national, and regional trends.

Key features:
- Creation of views summarizing COVID-19 data.
- Calculations of key metrics like death rates, case percentages, and vaccination rates.
- Comparative analysis of various regions (e.g., Africa) with global insights.

### Project 2: AdventureWorks Data Analysis

This project uses the **AdventureWorks2019** sample database to demonstrate SQL querying skills. The project involves creating dimension and fact tables, preparing customer data, and conducting analysis based on customer attributes, order data, and sales.

Key features:
- Creation of dimension tables for customer data.
- Aggregation of sales and order information.
- Analysis of customer age groups, locations, and other demographic insights.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL Server**: Database management system used for querying and managing the data.
- **T-SQL**: Transact-SQL for creating views, tables, and performing queries in SQL Server.
